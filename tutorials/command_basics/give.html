    <p>
      The give command has 3 paramaters - a <code>target selector</code> (the player to give the item to), an <code>item stack</code> (the item's ID and components), and an <code>int</code> (the item count). Only the first two paramaters are required. If the last paramater is ignored, the amount of items will be 1.
    </p>
    <br><p>
      Here is an example:
    </p><br>
    <div class="codezone"><p>/give @p minecraft:apple[] 1</p></div>
    <br><p>
      Of course, that is a very basic example. You can modify the item's properties using the components in the item stack paramater.
    </p><br>
    <div class="codezone"><p>/give @p minecraft:apple[
  item_name= "Shiny Red Apple",
  enchantment_glint_override= true
] 12</p></div>
    <p>
      "But hold on, I don't understand that! You just introduced me to the /give command and this comes up straight away!"
    </p><br>
    <p>I totally get you. In Bedrock Edition, the /give command has components that work similar to block states. However, in Java Edition, we use components to not just, for example, force the item to stay in one inventory slot, but to apply certain characteristics to the item they are put on. Whilst I will leave the topic of item components to their own tutorial (see below), I can give you a teaser. In the above example, we give the apple a 'glowing' or 'enchanted' effect. This is acheived through the <code>minecraft:enchantment_glint_override</code> component. Every item component is provided its value through an equals (<code>=</code>) sign.</p><br>
