    <p>Minecraft has tons of opportunities for creativity and exploration, making it probably the best game to allow for customisation and expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creators have been modding and altering the game for quite some time, and recently (2-3 years ago) I decided to get my hands into this stuff. I'm TheKnytemayor, and I'll guide you through the basics of Minecraft Content Creation, with data packs, commands and mods (I'll get to the latter in a few months).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to read about me and my journey to where I am now, read past this section, otherwise, explore my site. I've sorted it into a few pages that should get you going as a Minecraft content creator, and possibly as a career.

    <h1 style="padding-left:15px;color:var(--theme-purple)" title="Advancement made!">How did we get here?</h1>
    <p>
      It all began when I was 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was introduced to Minecraft (Bedrock Edition) being this little game where you can build and survive, as a survival game with the goal being to take down the mysterious legend that cowered in a barren land called The End. I thought that the dragon would send their endermen to take down the overworld and claim new territory (surprise came later when Minecraft Legends were announced). Everyone was doing it the same way, but I wanted something different. Other people had told me that Minecraft was an open sandbox, a game where you build your dream, and I believe that is true. I found that for some reason, creative mode was unavailable. How mysterious. I then found out that I needed an account, so I made one and named it 'InhumanMars2535'. The numbers sounded cool too. I liked the idea of my character being an alien, not from earth, being a bit mysterious, reflecting the recursive word in this very story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon I came to watch YouTube videos, from channels like EYStream. I built their creations in my own world and was satisfied, but not very much. I liked the idea of creating. Create. What a word. It felt powerful, but not in a narcissistic way. To have true control over my Minecraft world, and to create new things for the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next phase was when I was told (I forgot who by), about Java Edition. I thought "what the? Is that for 15 year olds, or is it advanced??", and to some extent, yes, it was. But a bit. I found the same kinds of things, but when I began to research "how to create your own minecraft mob", or something similar, I found they were using some block called a 'command block'.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried it out, found some buttons, and watched various videos explaining how to use them. "Pretty interesting", I thought. But it wasn't until Year 6 at school, that one of my classmates showed me what snapshots were. I was intrigued, and when I got home that day, I instantly tried it out. I hopped on my computer upstairs and Googled what the latest snapshot was. 20w21a. Custom worlds. Custom. Custom. That word invited me in to learn how to create them, but I was stuck. I needed a generator. Misode. Ah, misode.github.io, how I can't forget nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in 1.19, Custom worlds were no longer supported. You could no longer "import settings", as the button was called.As well as that, just by watching a video about custom dimensions instantly threw me into data packs. I was scrolling through the current data-driven folders, wondering what to do- and then I remembered commands. And at that moment, I saw Functions. Interesting... running multiple commands at once--
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in 1.20.[I forgot], macros were introduced. a very necessary addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      And today, after years of [behind-the-scenes-of-this-story-learning-and-command-ing], I decided to make a YouTube channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, here I am, in 2025.
