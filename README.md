## My Github Pages Website

My Github Page documents all of the important information from my YouTube videos, as wells as providing links to them. I share how I started making Minecraft command videos, and give you easy access to what you need to know.
Currently, there is no Tutorials page, however I will add it in hopefully less than a week.

DISCLAIMER:
If you find that a user 'TheKnytemayor666' is editing this site, it is only a glitch. I am signed into Github from VS Code on my computer as WaedythArterial, and for some reason Github makes the commits from TheKnytemayor666's profile. The reason why I have made this disclaimer is because I have lost access to Github accounts such as 'TheKnytemayor', 'TheKnytemayorMC' and 'TheKnytemayor66'.
